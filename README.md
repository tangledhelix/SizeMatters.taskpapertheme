A [TaskPaper][] theme for those of us who no longer have the eyesight of
a 25-year-old.

[taskpaper]: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/taskpaper/id424281111?mt=12

Features:

* No fonts smaller than 16 points
* Helvetica (font-snob approved!)
* Colors that won't make your eyes bleed
* 35% less squinting

To install, copy `SizeMatters.taskpapertheme` to
`~/Library/Application Support/TaskPaper/Themes`, then select `SizeMatters`
as your theme in TaskPaper's preferences.

You may have to restart TaskPaper to get it to see the new theme file.
